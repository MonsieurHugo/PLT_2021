# Game-presentation
 
 
## Introduction
 
 
Our game is based on Slay. It's a turn-based strategy game made by Sean O'Connor and released in the United Kingdom for Microsoft Windows in March 1995.
 
 
## Object of the game
 
 
The goal is to capture the whole island by killing all the enemies and capture their land. For that, one can buy soldiers and move them on the board.
 
 
## Gameplay
 
 
Slay is played on a hexagonal board. The players are given one or more little territory at first, which they have to grow by moving soldiers. A territory is formed by at least two cells, and have is own capital, shown by a house. The more cells you have in your territory,the more money you earn. You can increase your gain by buying little farms. They are different levels of soldier which cost different prices and consume different amounts of resources. You also can place towers on the map in order to protect territory from the opponent.
 
 
### The Map
 
 
When the game starts, the map is divided into territory. Hexagonal cells of the same colors form territories. Territories with more than one cell include a village.
 
 
### Incomes
 
Each of your territories earns 1 credit for each cell which is in it that does not have tree on it.
 
 
### Outcomes
 
A new peasant costs 10 and a farm costs 15.
 
The territory has to pay wages to each soldier on it.
 
| Name         | Cost     |
| -------------   |:-------------:|
| Peasant     | 2$               |
| Spearman  | 6$              |
| Knight        | 18$              |
| Baron        | 54$               |
 
If a territory does not have enough resources to pay, all its soldiers die, turning into gravestones, which will be replaced by trees next turn.
 
# Rules
 
 
## Starting
 
 
When the game starts, every player is given a little territory and some resources in order to allow them to buy soldiers to start conquer. When it’s your turn, you can buy as many soldiers, farms and towers as you can with the money that you have, and move every soldier that you have, one time for each.
 
 
## Permitted moves
 
 
### Moving men
 
 
While your man hasn't capture an enemy cells nor chopped down a tree during the turn, you can move him as many times as you want within your own territory.
 
 
#### Attacking
 
 
You can control each of your men. They can do one of the two different attack moves.
on your territory :  
* chop down a tree
on enemy territory :
* one attack on any hexagon adjoining their territory a man with a lower level.
 
 
| Men | Level |
|---------|----|
| Peasant | 1 |
| Spearman | 2 |
| Knight | 3 |
| Baron | 4 |
 
 
The attacking piece must be stronger than the enemy's defence (to make stronger men you must combine two of your existing men). For example:
 
A peasant could not take a hexagon which has an enemy peasant on it nor any of the hexagons that the enemy peasant is defending.
 
A spearman could kill the peasant or take any of the hexagons surrounding the peasant as spearmen are stronger than peasants.
 
It takes at least a knight to capture an enemy castle, or a hexagon defended by it.  
 
### Combining Men  
 
 
One stronger man can be created by combining two less stronger men. It can be achieved by placing one of the men on top of another one. Both have to be on the same territory.
The strength of the produced man is obtained by summing the strength of the two units used. You can’t merge two units that would result in a man with a strength greater than the most powerful unit (Baron 4).  
 
 
As a result, only some fusion are possible :
1. Peasant (1) + Peasant (1) = Spearman (2)
2. Peasant (1) + Spearman (2) = Knight (3)
3. Peasant (1) + Knight (3) = Baron (4)
4. Spearman (2) + Spearman (2) = Baron (4)
 
 
 
 
## Forbidden moves
 
 
You cannot move a man more than one cell next to your territory.  
 
## Combining territories
 
You can combine territories by joining them with captured cells.
 
 
## Tree
 
Cells with tree on it do not provide money. They grow on empty cells which are surrounded by two or more trees.
